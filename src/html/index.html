          <p>With a population of 31.8 million, the Republic of Angola's gross domestic product (GDP) was  USD 84. 6 billion in current prices in 2019.</p>
          <p>This is relatively high compared to other sub-Saharan African countries, and remarkable for a least developed country (LDC). There has been a steady growth in GDP per capita rising from 745 US dollars in 2000 to 2,658 US dollars in 2019 (current prices). However, despite the growth over time, the most recent trend has been negative, with GDP per capita falling from 4,167 US dollars in 2015.  The decline is due to the combined effect of low international oil price and the impact of COVID19- which  is the result of weak productive capacities of Angola  and lack of structural transformation in its economy.</p>
          <p>Despite the exceptional improvement in GDP per capita, progress in economic diversification and advances in social and human-capital development has been limited. These challenges continue to be daunting.</p>
          <p>Angola remains heavily dependent on oil, which accounts for a whopping 93% of the nation's total merchandise exports (2019). The recent decline in international oil prices has further aggravated the vulnerability of the country to external shocks.</p>
          <p>Overdependence on a single export item (oil) has also discouraged the country from incorporating into global value chains and participating more fully in the export of manufactured goods and value-added services.</p>
